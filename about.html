                        <p>Ever since 3rd grade, Justin wanted to be an author. He'd wake up early before school each morning to wrap himself in a blanket, go sit on the heater, and read the book he was working on. Soon he wanted to write books of his own.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, in high school, he started to write his first novel. Though he kept himself busy with school—winning the Math Sterling Scholar award for his high school and becoming Valedictorian—he wrote a little here, a little there. In the summers, he worked on a golf course and washing windows, jobs that allowed him to listen to Writing Excuses—a podcast that teaches writing strategy—and plot his books in his head. Over the course of a year and a half, he chipped away at this endeavor and emerged with his first novel: <i>Alabard</i>.</p>
                        <p>Soon after, he served an LDS mission in Arizona, Ethiopia, and Kenya over the next two years.  During that time, he learned to speak Amharic. He occasionally would write during this time, beginning the sequel to his first novel. He continues to work on this novel today and hopes to continue writing during the course of the next few years.</p>
                        <p>Justin is currently a Pre-Business student at Brigham Young University in his freshman year. He writes in his free time, working toward the day that he can become professionally published.</p>
