                        <p>The secret to writing is that there is no one way to do it. But there are general rules that need to be followed. The most skilled writers learn the art of how to break these rules and when to.</p>
                        <p>There are many authors out there who want to give back to the community. But each one has a different philosophy and way of going about it. One of the most frustrating things for a young writer is hearing one author say one thing, and another say the complete opposite. For example, Orson Scott Card will tell you that an outline is essential. Stephen King will tell you that an outline will ruin your book. Both are wildly successful authors. So which is right?</p>
                        <p>Well, the answer is that they both are. So which one should you follow? The answer is the one that works best for you. Some will work better with an outline, and some are better at discovering their book as they go. Both are viable options. Both have pros and cons.</p>
                        <p>So how do you know which one you should use? The answer is that you try them both out and see which one works for you. The only way to get better at writing is to do it. Experiment a little. Make mistakes. Enjoy it! Over time you’ll find yourself falling into your own habits, and you’ll find yourself becoming much more comfortable as a writer.</p>
                        <p>So go out. Learn more. And find the type of writing that works for you!</p>
